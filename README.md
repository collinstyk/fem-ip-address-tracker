## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Object Oriented
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

### Continued development

I need to improve in the area of version control with git and coding with typescript.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) - This helped me understand typescript.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website cover most part of frontend development. Just search for anything relating to HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
- [Typescript-Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
